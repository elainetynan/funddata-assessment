Worked through exercies on Randomness.
I was familiar with probability and some coin flip examples so this was nice to learn new stuff with a familiar backdrop.
Exercises 1 and 2 completed in notbook.

Tried the code from the class.
The class code was on Entropy. It investigates the entropy of a randomly generated strings (0s and 1s) as well as the entropy of Fire Alarms and Pincodes.

Added an explanation (in my own words) as to why the log of zero is not defined.

Modified code written by lecturer (Ian McLoughlin)
Code modified to output 1000 characters instead of the same length as the paragraph from Alice in Wonderland.
Code also modified to calculate the weightings of the next probable character (from a list of letters and the space generated from the Alice in Wonderland excerpt) based on the 2 previous characters as oposed to just the 1 previous character.
Result seems to be correct and is quite pleasing as the generated exerpt is another step closer to the English language.
